Sixth sense is a forray into threejs, 3D Graphics and the wonderful world of aerodynamics. You can check out the simulator I created at [this link]() It isn't very accurate, only deals with the magnus force's effects on a baseball and is completely inspired by Alan Nathan's [Determining the 3D Spin Axis from Statcast Data](http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/trackman/spinaxis.pdf). The innacuracy is my fault btw, not Prof. Nathan's. For now, I have put this project aside. However, what I have learned from this brief foray into aerodynamics has been really fun and poses a lot of questions that may end up in future blog posts. 

Here are some useful links to anyone looking to dip their toe into the cross between aerodynamics and baseball:
