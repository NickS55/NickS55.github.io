## Why I chose Haskell:
After spending time learning about functional programming 
and its promise of being a more robust programming paradigm
compared to imperative programming, I decided to learn [Haskell](haskell.org). 

<br/>

There are a lot of ways to descibe Haskell as a programming language. 
However, it is best known for being a purely functional programming language 
that aims to use lambda calculus to help programmers avoid the common pitfalls 
of modern software development.

<br/>

I chose Haskell over other similar programming languages (i.e. OCaml, Scala, Elm, etc...)
 because it is a purely funcitnoal language with an established community. This would make it
 impossible to fall back into writing ["impure" functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function)
 and provide established libraries to use, respectively.

## Step 1: Learning the basics of Haskell

ON PAUSE as I work on OwnYourGame

## Step 2: Translating an already existing program into Haskell

## step 3: Creating a new Program from scratch
